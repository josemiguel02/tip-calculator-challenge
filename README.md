## My process
I started by making the semantic HTML, I gave classes applying the BEM methodology, then I went on to design it with SCSS, I separated the files by blocks, I made the card with Grid, I went on to the Responsive design with media queries and finally I made the logic of the calculator with OOP.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM Methodology
- Mobile-first workflow
- OOP

### What I learned
In this section, I learned how to use SCSS to design the user interface and how to modularize the BEM methodology blocks into separate .scss files.
